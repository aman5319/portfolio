# Bio

I'm Aman Kumar Pandey, a Data Scientist with 6+ years of experience working at the intersection of applied AI, recommender systems, and multilingual NLP. My work blends research and engineering — from building large-scale retrieval + ranking pipelines to enabling NLP in low-resource settings. I believe in open research, free software, and using technology to empower communities.

Outside work, I contribute through teaching, community-led open-source AI initiatives, and occasionally dive into functional programming and math.

Let’s connect and explore ideas in AI, recommender systems, or multilingual tech for real-world impact.
