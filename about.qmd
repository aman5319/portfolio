# Bio
  I am **Data Scientist**, **Computer Programmer** and **Mathematician**.
  
  I have worked majorly in **Natual Language Processing**, **Natural Language Generation** and 
  **Recommendation Engines** in different Buisness domain.

  Over the years in companies I have worked all of them demanded 
  innovations and ingenuity to be added to solve the complex problems in hand
  which has kept me ahead in this fast moving AI Research Landscape.

  My love for human speaking languages lead me to dwell deeper into the world of NLP.

  On a side note - I **can speak 5 Languages** and at one point I even learned American Sign Language as well which i don't remember very well these days.

  Something I believe so deeply is **Free software**, and **Free Education** for everyone which lead me conduct multiple meetups, workshop, events. What I learned from the community I gave back to the community.

  **I advocate for open research.**
  These days I am fueled by **enthusiasm to do mathematics** from completely different perspective.
